## Description

Add configurable, per-business rate limiting to prevent abuse and spam submissions of attestations by a single business or address.

Implements a **sliding time-window** model where each business can submit at most `max_submissions` attestations within any `window_seconds`-wide window.

## Changes

### New Files
- **`contracts/attestation/src/rate_limit.rs`** — Core rate limiting module with `RateLimitConfig` struct, sliding-window enforcement (`check_rate_limit`), submission recording (`record_submission`), and read-only queries
- **`contracts/attestation/src/rate_limit_test.rs`** — 14 comprehensive tests covering enforcement, window expiry, per-business isolation, backward compatibility, and edge cases
- **`docs/attestation-rate-limits.md`** — Full documentation of the rate limiting model, configuration parameters, algorithm, storage design, and integration flow

### Modified Files
- **`contracts/attestation/src/lib.rs`** — Added `configure_rate_limit` admin entry point, integrated `check_rate_limit()` in `submit_attestation` (before fee collection), added `get_rate_limit_config` and `get_submission_window_count` query methods
- **`contracts/attestation/src/dynamic_fees.rs`** — Extended `DataKey` enum with `RateLimitConfig` and `SubmissionTimestamps(Address)` variants
- **`contracts/attestation/src/events.rs`** — Added `RateLimitConfigChangedEvent` struct and `emit_rate_limit_config_changed` emission function

## Requirements Addressed

- ✅ Per-business or per-caller submission limits over a time window
- ✅ Exposed configuration for rate limit thresholds (`max_submissions`, `window_seconds`, `enabled`)
- ✅ Graceful failure when limits are exceeded (`panic!("rate limit exceeded")`)
- ✅ Secure — admin-only configuration, business auth required
- ✅ Tested — 14 new tests, 103 total passing, 0 regressions
- ✅ Documented — `docs/attestation-rate-limits.md` with NatSpec-style code comments
- ✅ Designed to avoid unnecessary state writes (lazy pruning, write-on-change-only)
